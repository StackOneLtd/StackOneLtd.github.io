              <h3>Working at the Manukau District Court, our client is a busy barrister whose days are filled with court appearances and client consultations.</h3>

            <div class="w-richtext">
              <p>Technology was an afterthought, often "managed" by well-meaning family and friends from younger generations. This ad-hoc approach led to a patchwork of solutions that didn't quite fit her professional needs.</p>
              <h4>Challenges</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Missing Emails and Invites:</strong> Crucial emails and calendar invites were slipping through the cracks due to an outdated email service set up over a decade ago.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Sync Across Devices:</strong> Emails, calendars, and files weren't syncing because her old services didn't support modern technologies.</li>
                <li><strong>No Clear Support Expertise:</strong> Relying on family members without a holistic understanding of professional tech led to temporary fixes and "shadow IT" problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Unnecessary Costs:</strong> She was paying hundreds of dollars each month without knowing why. Each helper added new subscriptions, like 12 unnecessary Teams Essentials licenses, when a simple Microsoft 365 subscription would have sufficed at a fraction of the cost.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Concerns:</strong> Running two antivirus programs made her systems painfully slow. Without understanding security basics like multi-factor authentication (MFA), she was worried but unprotected.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>We started with a thorough review of her professional needs to tailor the right solution. We identified her pain points and implemented key technologies:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Microsoft 365:</strong> Streamlined her email, calendar, files, and Teams for seamless syncing across all devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Tenant-Wide Backup:</strong> Ensured all her data is securely backed up across Microsoft 365 services.</li>
                <li><strong>Intune Device Management:</strong> Provided secure and efficient management of all her devices.</li>
              </ul>

              <p class="large-paragraph">Engaging StackOne has been transformative for my legal practice. Previously, outdated technology and piecemeal solutions led to missed emails, unsynced calendars, and security concerns—issues that not only caused frustration but also impacted my ability to serve my clients effectively. StackOne conducted a thorough assessment of my professional needs and implemented Microsoft 365 along with advanced security measures. Now, my communications and files sync
                seamlessly across all devices, and I have confidence in the security of my data. They've also helped me eliminate unnecessary subscriptions, saving me over $100 each month. Their professional support allows me to focus entirely on my legal work without the distraction of tech headaches.</p>

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <div class="w-richtext">
              <p>Understanding the demands of her profession, we offered ongoing support and training that fit her schedule. We clearly explained each step, making sure she was comfortable with the changes and understood the benefits.</p>
              <h4>Customized Migration Plan</h4>
              <p>With her busy schedule in mind, we developed a customized migration plan that minimized downtime. We scheduled the transition during off-peak hours and systematically migrated her emails, calendars, and files to Microsoft 365. Our team ensured that all data was securely transferred without any loss, and that her new setup was configured to sync seamlessly across all devices.</p>
              <h4>Personalized Training and Ongoing Support</h4>
              <p>Understanding that new technology can be overwhelming, we provided personalized training sessions tailored to her pace and level of tech comfort. We walked her through the features of Microsoft 365, Intune device management, and the new security protocols. Additionally, we established a direct line of communication for ongoing support, so she knows exactly who to contact for any future assistance.</p>
